# Free Algebras

Universal algebra approach to free algebras (including higher order structures
like functors, applicative functors or monads).  Mathematical introduction
alongside with some  Haskell ideas can be found
[here](https://marcinszamotulski.me/posts/free-monads.html).

For an example check out [this](https://github.com/coot/free-algebras/blob/master/examples/src/Network/TCP.hs).
