Universal algebra approach (which is compatible with categorical approach) to
free algebras (including higher order structures like functors, applicative
functors or monads).  Mathematical introduction alongside with some of the
Haskell ideas is desribed in a [blog](https://coot.me/posts/free-monads.html)
post.

Examples:
---------

* [TCP as a free monad](https://github.com/coot/free-algebras/blob/master/examples/src/Network/TCP.hs)
* [free categories](https://coot.me/posts/kleisli-categories-and-free-monads.html)
* [free categories with monadic effects](https://coot.me/posts/categories-with-monadic-effects.html)
* [free category package](https://hackage.haskell.org/package/free-category)
